Job Seq Prob with CSV file

In this project, a solution to the Job Sequencing Problem (JSP) is developed using Python and the Streamlit library for creating interactive web applications. The JSP involves scheduling a set of jobs with associated deadlines and profits to maximize the total profit. The provided code begins by importing necessary libraries, including Streamlit for the user interface, Pandas for data manipulation, and Altair for data visualization. Additionally, sample data is loaded from a CSV file, allowing users to observe how the solution operates on realistic datasets.

The core functionality of the application lies in the `job_sequencing()` function, which implements a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal sequence of jobs. Jobs are sorted by profit in descending order, and then iteratively assigned to time slots based on their deadlines. If a job cannot be accommodated before its deadline, it is appended to the sequence at the end. This algorithm ensures that the most profitable jobs are prioritized while respecting their deadlines, resulting in an efficient and effective scheduling solution.

Furthermore, the Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the solution. It displays the sample data, computes the job sequence and total profit, and visualizes the job deadlines and profits using Altair. The visualization enhances understanding by presenting a graphical representation of how profits are distributed relative to deadlines, allowing users to gain insights into the scheduling decisions made by the algorithm. Overall, this project demonstrates the power of Python and Streamlit in developing user-friendly solutions for complex optimization problems like the Job Sequencing Problem.
